        "KoboldAI is a powerful and easy way to use a variety of AI based text generation experiences. You can use it to write stories, blog posts, play a text adventure game, use it like a chatbot and more! In some cases it might even help you with an assignment or programming task (But always make sure the information the AI mentions is correct, it loves to make stuff up).\n",

        "1. On a phone? First put your browser in desktop mode because of a Google Colab bug. Otherwise nothing will happen when you click the play button. Then tap the play button next to \"<-- Tap This if you play on Mobile\", you will see an audio player. Keep the audio player playing so Colab does not get shut down in the background.\n",
        "2. Select the desired model, you will find a description of all the available models further down the page.\n",
        "3. Click the play button next to \"<-- Select your model below and then click this to start KoboldAI\".\n",
        "4. Got a message saying no accelerator is available? Click cancel, and try again in a few minutes. If you do not manage to get a session when you frequently try again try at a different time of day, colab can be busy or your priority may have been lowered by frequent usage.\n",
        "5. After everything is done loading you will get a link that you can use to open KoboldAI. In case of Localtunnel you will also be warned that some people are abusing Localtunnel for phishing, once you acknowledge this warning you will be taken to KoboldAI's interface. If you picked Cloudflare and get a 1033 error refresh the error page after waiting one minute.\n",

        "Further down the page you can find descriptions of the models, and tips to get the most out of your Google Colab experience.\n",

        "Make sure to keep this page open while you are using KoboldAI, and check back regularly to see if you got a Captcha. Failure to complete the captcha's in time can result in termination of your session or a lower priority towards the TPUs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Firefox users need to disable the enhanced tracking protection or use a different browser in order to be able to use Google Colab without errors (This is not something we can do anything about, the cookie blocker breaks the Google Drive integration because it uses different domains)."

The end result is a very diverse model that is heavily biased towards SFW novel writing, but one that can go beyond its novel training and make for an excellent adventure model to. Adventure mode is best played from a second person perspective, but can be played in first or third person as well. Novel writing can be done best from the first or third person. |\n",

This model is capable of replacing both the Lit and Shinen models in terms of content and style and has been well received as (one of) the best NSFW models out there. If you wish to use this model for commercial or non research usage we recommend choosing the 20B version as that one is not subject to the restrictive OPT license. |\n",
        "| [Janeway](https://huggingface.co/KoboldAI/fairseq-dense-13B-Janeway) by Mr Seeker | Novel | Janeway is a model created from Picard's dataset combined with a brand new collection of ebooks. This model is trained on 20% more content than Picard and has been trained on literature from various genres. Although the model is mainly focussed on SFW, romantic scenes might involve a degree of nudity. |\n",
        "| [Shinen](https://huggingface.co/KoboldAI/fairseq-dense-13B-Shinen) by Mr Seeker | NSFW | Shinen is an NSFW model trained on a variety of stories from the website Sexstories it contains many different kinks. It has been merged into the larger (and better) Erebus model. |\n",
        "| [Skein](https://huggingface.co/KoboldAI/GPT-J-6B-Skein) by VE\\_FORBRYDERNE | Adventure | Skein is best used with Adventure mode enabled, it consists of a 4 times larger adventure dataset than the Adventure model making it excellent for text adventure gaming. On top of that it also consists of light novel training further expanding its knowledge and writing capabilities. It can be used with the You filter bias if you wish to write Novels with it, but dedicated Novel models can perform better for this task. |\n",
        "| [Adventure](https://huggingface.co/KoboldAI/GPT-J-6B-Adventure) by VE\\_FORBRYDERNE | Adventure | Adventure is a 6B model designed to mimick the behavior of AI Dungeon. It is exclusively for Adventure Mode and can take you on the epic and wackey adventures that AI Dungeon players love. It also features the many tropes of AI Dungeon as it has been trained on very similar data. It must be used in second person (You). |\n",

First the model originates from LitV2, it was then trained by Haru on a chat dataset to create ConvoGPT. ConvoGPT was then trained by PygmalionAI on chat data that contains longer responses and emotions. Making for a higher quality chat experience than you can get from other models such as Erebus that are not directly trained on chatting. |\n",

Creating a high quality model for your NSFW stories. This model is exclusively a novel model and is best used in third person. |\n",
        "| [OPT](https://huggingface.co/facebook/opt-13b) by Metaseq | Generic | OPT is considered one of the best base models as far as content goes, its behavior has the strengths of both GPT-Neo and Fairseq Dense. Compared to Neo duplicate and unnecessary content has been left out, while additional literature was added in similar to the Fairseq Dense model. The Fairseq Dense model however lacks the broader data that OPT does have. The biggest downfall of OPT is its license, which prohibits any commercial usage, or usage beyond research purposes. |\n",
        "| [Neo(X)](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-neox-20b) by EleutherAI | Generic | NeoX is the largest EleutherAI model currently available, being a generic model it is not particularly trained towards anything and can do a variety of writing, Q&A and coding tasks. 20B's performance is closely compared to the 13B models and it is worth trying both especially if you have a task that does not involve english writing. Its behavior will be similar to the GPT-J-6B model since they are trained on the same dataset but with more sensitivity towards repetition penalty and with more knowledge. |\n",
        "| [Fairseq Dense](https://huggingface.co/KoboldAI/fairseq-dense-13B) | Generic | Trained by Facebook Researchers this model stems from the MOE research project within Fairseq. This particular version has been converted by us for use in KoboldAI. It is known to be on par with the larger 20B model from EleutherAI and considered as better for pop culture and language tasks. Because the model has never seen a new line (enter) it may perform worse on formatting and paragraphing. Compared to other models the dataset focuses primarily on literature and contains little else. |\n",

Being trained on the Pile and not biased towards anything in particular it is suitable for a variety of tasks such as writing, Q&A and coding tasks. You will likely get better result with larger generic models or finetuned models. |\n",

Do not use KoboldAI's save function and instead click Download as .json, this will automatically download the story to your own computer without ever touching Google's harddrives. You can load this back trough the Load from file option.\n",
